## Piatra . Institute


Focused on developing technologies for the public good, the institute offers licensing options for private entities interested in commercialization. 

Exploring direct-to-consumer sales, the aim is to enhance accessibility (running as much as possible of the software locally or through self-hosting) and promote wider availability of technologies (let the users replace back-ends, APIs, as needed).
