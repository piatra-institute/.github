## Piatra . Institute


Focused on developing technologies for the public good, the institute offers licensing options for private entities interested in commercialization. 

Exploring direct-to-consumer sales, the aim is to enhance:
+ accessibility—running as much as possible of the software locally or through self-hosting,
+ & availability—let the users replace back-ends, APIs, as needed.
